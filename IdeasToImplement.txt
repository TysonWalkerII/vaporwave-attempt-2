A que of music that everyone on the website can listen to
Anyone can add whatever they want

Precautionary measures:
-limit people to one request( they won’t be able to add another song until a certain amount of requests are made from others depending on how many people are on it)
-people can toggle a skip bool and if a certain amount of people skip it, then the song is skipped and everyones toggle is put back to false
And a chat honestly I’m not sure why I never added this sooner it would be cool for people to be able to chat and stuff
Precautionary measures: maybe people can block others so that they don’t notice messages from people they don’t wanna see

Precautionary measures:
- can't do consecutive submissions
- people can vote the song off (with a toggle)
